Project Overview
This project is an interactive web page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The page features a slider that reveals different content and images as you interact with it. The project demonstrates basic web development skills and the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and animation.

Features
Interactive Slider: A range slider that reveals different sections of content as it moves.
Dynamic Content Display: Gradients, text, and images are dynamically shown or hidden based on the slider's value.
Responsive Design: The page layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on various devices.
File Structure
index.html: The main structure of the web page. It includes links to the stylesheets and the JavaScript file, as well as the HTML elements for the content.
styles.css: Contains the basic styling for the page, including layout, fonts, colors, and the appearance of various elements.
query.css: Provides additional styles for responsiveness, ensuring the page looks good on screens with a width of 1280px or less.
index.js: The JavaScript file that controls the slider’s behavior. It handles showing and hiding content based on the slider’s position.
How It Works
Initial Setup: When the page loads, all content is hidden by default.
Slider Interaction: As the user moves the slider, different sections of content are revealed. The script listens for changes in the slider’s value and updates the visibility of gradients, text, and images accordingly.
Responsive Design: The page adjusts its layout when the screen width is below 1280px, ensuring usability across devices.
